## what i did was to mimic the thought pattern that was shown in the example
## the first function will hold a place for the inverse matrix as well as nested function
## the nested function will be able to get the original matrix, set it, get the inverse matrix
##and set the inverse matrix.
## the second function will check for a chached value. if it's there- the funtion will return it
## else, the function will calculate the inverse matrix, store it in first function and will print it.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
